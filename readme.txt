Adds the CSV format to GlotPress to export/import translations and originals.

== Description ==

Adds the CSV format to GlotPress to export/import translations and originals.

This allows you to export a translation set to a CSV file, and use this to import the translations or originals into the project.

This plugin is properly prepared for localization.

== The CSV Format ==

The CSV output has values separated by `,` and enclosured by `" "`.

The total number of columns depends on the number of Plural Forms of the exported Locale.

For an sample file, please check out [example.csv](https://github.com/pedro-mendonca/GP-Format-CSV/blob/main/example.csv).

The header columns for the different translations have the `Translation (<plural-form>)` naming convention, being the Plural Forms depending on each exported Locale.

See the example below for a **Portuguese** CSV export, which has `2` plural forms.

= The exported CSV in plain text =

	"Context","Singular","Plural","Comments","References","Translation (Singular)","Translation (Plural)"
	"","Singular in English.","","Comment 1.\nComment 2.","","Singular em PortuguÃªs.",""

= The main columns =

The 5 main columns are `Context`, `Singular`, `Plural`, `Comments` and `References`.

= The Plural Forms variable columns =

The number of Plural Forms columns may vary depending on each Locale setting.

Check the below table for examples of [GlotPress Locales](https://github.com/GlotPress/GlotPress/blob/develop/locales/locales.php) from 1 to 6 Plural Forms.
