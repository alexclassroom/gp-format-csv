## Description

Adds the CSV format to GlotPress to export and import translations.

This plugin is properly prepared for localization.

### The table format

The CSV output has values separated by `,` and enclosured by `" "`.  
The total number of columns depends on the number of Plural Forms of the exported Locale.  
See the example below for a **Portuguese** CSV export, which has `2` plural forms.  

**The exported CSV in plain text**
```csv
"Context","Singular","Plural","Comments","Translation for Singular","Translation for Plural"
"","Singular in English.","","Comment 1.\nComment 2.","Singular em Portugu√™s.",""
```

**The exported CSV in table format**
| Context | Singular | Plural | Comments | Translation for Singular | Translation for Plural |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | *Singular in English.* | | *Comment 1.\nComment 2.* | *Singular em Portugu√™s.* | |

### The main columns

The 4 main columns are `Context`, `Singular`, `Plural` and `Comments`.

| Context | Singular | Plural | Comments | Plural Form(s)... |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *value* | *value* | *value* | *value* | |
| *value* | *value* | *value* | *value* | |

### The Plural Forms variable columns
 
The number of Plural Forms columns may vary depending on each Locale setting.  
Check the below table for examples of [GlotPress Locales](https://github.com/GlotPress/GlotPress/blob/develop/locales/locales.php) from 1 to 6 Plural Forms.  
| Locale (nplurals) | ...Comments | Plural Form 1 | Plural Form 2 | Plural Form 3 | Plural Form 4 | Plural Form 5 | Plural Form 6 |
