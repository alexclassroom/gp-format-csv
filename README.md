## Description

Adds the CSV format to GlotPress to export/import translations and originals.

This allows you to export a translation set to a CSV file, and use this to import the translations or originals into the project.

This plugin is properly prepared for localization.

## The CSV Format

The CSV output has values separated by `,` and enclosured by `" "`.  
The total number of columns depends on the number of Plural Forms of the exported Locale.  
For an sample file, please check out [example.csv](https://github.com/pedro-mendonca/GP-Format-CSV/blob/main/example.csv).  
The header columns for the different translations have the `Translation (<plural-form>)` naming convention, being the Plural Forms depending on each exported Locale.  
See the example below for a **Portuguese** CSV export, which has `2` plural forms.  

### The exported CSV in plain text

```csv
"Context","Singular","Plural","Comments","References","Translation (Singular)","Translation (Plural)"
"","Singular in English.","","Comment 1.\nComment 2.","","Singular em Portugu√™s.",""
```

### The exported CSV in table format

| Context | Singular | Plural | Comments | References | Translation (Singular) | Translation (Plural) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | *Singular in English.* | | *Comment 1.\nComment 2.* | | *Singular em Portugu√™s.* | |

### The main columns

The 5 main columns are `Context`, `Singular`, `Plural`, `Comments` and `References`.

| Context | Singular | Plural | Comments | References | Translation(s)... |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *value* | *value* | *value* | *value* | *value* | |
| *value* | *value* | *value* | *value* | *value* | |

### The Plural Forms variable columns
 
The number of Plural Forms columns may vary depending on each Locale setting.  
Check the below table for examples of [GlotPress Locales](https://github.com/GlotPress/GlotPress/blob/develop/locales/locales.php) from 1 to 6 Plural Forms.

| Locale (nplurals) | ...Comments | Translation (Singular) | Translation (Plural 1) | Translation (Plural 2) | Translation (Plural 3) | Translation (Plural 4) | Translation (Plural 5)
